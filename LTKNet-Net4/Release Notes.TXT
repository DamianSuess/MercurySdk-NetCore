4. Bugs fixed and Feature added

   November 27th 2008

    1) NOTE: The LTK.NET namespace has changed to Org.LLRP.LTK.LLRPV1. This is a 
	non-backward compatible change.
    2) Occasionally the LTK.NET would loose sync with the reader and require a connection reset.  This
	was due to packet stream processing in the tcp_connection layer.  It was corrected with a new
	packet stream processing model
