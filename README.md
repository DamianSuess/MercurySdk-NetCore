# Jadak Mercury Sdk for .NET 6

Cross-platform .NET SDK for the Mercury SDK based on v1.35.1 to allow developers to target Linux and Mac OS with .NET 5 and .NET 6.

At the time of writing, the Mercury SDK only supported .NET Framework v4 for Windows OS. This fork was built to fix that, enabling a true cross-platform Mercury SDK with .NET. The fork uses the [open-source SDK](https://www.jadaktech.com/products/thingmagic-rfid/thingmagic-mercury-api/) from Jadak, and I worked with their team to get permission to publish this work. Jadak has since absorbed it and they are using these fixes.
