# Jadak Mercury Sdk for .NET 6

Cross-platform .NET SDK for the Mercury SDK based on v1.35.1 to allow developers to target Linux and Mac OS with .NET 5 and .NET 6.

Currently, the Mercury SDK only supports .NET Framework v4 for Windows OS. This proof-of-concept fork is built on the [open-source SDK](https://www.jadaktech.com/products/thingmagic-rfid/thingmagic-mercury-api/) from Jadak.
